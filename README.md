# pandas-challenge

This challenge involves creating data frames and finding data trends within two databases  
The first database is small, it contains the names of a number of schools, the type of school they are and the number of pupils.
The second database contains approximately 39000 student names, the school they attended, the grade year in which they completed maths and english tests, and their maths and english results. 
I have analysed the data and my conclusions are within the python file.
